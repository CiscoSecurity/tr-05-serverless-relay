# Relay API Template

A generic Relay API template not bound to any third-party Threat Intelligence
service provider. The template aims to show the general structure for future
implementations. It also provides a couple of utility functions that might be
handy. Keep in mind that the main idea here is to just give a hint of a
possible approach rather than enforcing to do everything exactly the same way.

The API itself is just a simple Flask (WSGI) application which can be easily
packaged and deployed as an AWS Lambda Function working behind an AWS API
Gateway proxy using [Zappa](https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa).

An already deployed Relay API (e.g., packaged as an AWS Lambda Function) can
be pushed to Threat Response as a Relay Module using the
[Threat Response Relay CLI](https://github.com/threatgrid/tr-lambda-relay).

## Installation

```bash
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployment

As an AWS Lambda Function:
- Deploy: `zappa deploy dev`.
- Check: `zappa status dev`.
- Update: `zappa update dev`.
- Monitor: `zappa tail dev --http`.

**Note.** Check the following [document](aws/README.md) for more detailed
information and a set of concrete instructions on proper AWS setup.

As a TR Relay Module:
- Create: `relay add`.
- Update: `relay edit`.
- Delete: `relay remove`.

**Note.** For convenience, each TR Relay CLI command may be prefixed with
`env $(cat .env | xargs)` to automatically read the required environment
variables from a `.env` file (i.e.`TR_API_CLIENT_ID`, `TR_API_CLIENT_PASSWORD`,
`URL`, `JWT`) and pass them to the corresponding command.
