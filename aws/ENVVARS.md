# AWS Environment Variables

**NOTE.** Feel free to skip this document until you have deployed your Lambda
(check the [AWS HOWTO](HOWTO.md) for more details on how to properly set up your
AWS environment first and then follow the instructions from the
[README](../README.md) to finally deploy your Lambda). But once your Lambda has
been successfully deployed, make sure to return back to this document for some
extra configuration tweaks.

Unfortunately, Zappa does not have a good way to pass environment variables to
your Lambdas. Of course, the `aws_environment_variables` setting allows us to
use native AWS Lambda environment variables. These are useful as you can easily
change them via the AWS Lambda console at run-time. They are also useful for
storing sensitive credentials and to take advantage of KMS encryption of
environment variables.

The main problem with `aws_environment_variables` is that environment variables
have to be hard-coded into the configuration file, and this is not acceptable.

Example:
```json
{
    "dev": {
        "aws_environment_variables": {
            "key_1": "value_1",
            "key_2": "value_2",
            "key_3": "value_3",
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

So a better solution is to set environment variables via the AWS Lambda console
directly. The process itself is quite easy and can be done by going through the
following steps:

1. Go to the `AWS Lambda` console.
2. Select the `Functions` tab.
3. Find your Lambda and go to the corresponding configuration page.
4. Set your key-value pairs in the `Environment variables` section.
5. Click the `Save` button.

Thus, you can securely store your environment variables and dynamically change
them at run-time without having to re-deploy anything.
